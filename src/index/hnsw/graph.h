// Lock hierarchy
//
//   Graph Lock
//       -> Level Lock
//           -> Level Operation Lock
//               -> Neighbour Storage Lock (InnoDB MTR data-page latch)
//                   -> Overflow Storage Lock (InnoDB MTR data-page latch)
//
// Locks must be acquired from left to right. A lock at a higher level in
// this hierarchy must not be acquired while holding a lock at a lower
// level.
//
//   Level Locks:
//     - Acquire top-down by level.
//
//   Level Operation Locks:
//     - At most one may be held at a time.
//
//   Neighbour Storage Locks across levels:
//     - Acquire top-down by level.
//     - At most two may be held simultaneously.
//
//   Neighbour Storage Locks within one level:
//     - We don't acquire multiple storage locks simultaneously. It would
//       require ordering rules based on underlying pages, if needed.
//     - Instead, hold Level Operation Lock while adjusting links between nodes.
//
//   Overflow Storage Locks:
//     - Acquired only after all corresponding Neighbour Storage Locks.
//
// Operation-specific ordering:
//
//   Insert: linking neighbours
//     - Level Operation Lock: S.
//       Two concurrently inserted nodes cannot choose one another as
//       neighbours. Therefore, concurrent inserts do not require exclusive
//       serialization at the level.
//
//     - Neighbour Storage Locks:
//       Acquire the storage locks needed to update the new node and its
//       selected neighbours while holding the Level Operation Lock.
//
//   Insert/Delete: adjusting an existing node's neighbours
//     - Level Operation Lock: X.
//       This modifies an established connection and must be serialized
//       with other operations that may adjust the same existing node.
//
//     - Neighbour Storage Locks:
//       Acquire the storage locks needed for the affected nodes while
//       holding the Level Operation Lock. The operation lock prevents
//       concurrent graph operations from modifying the same relationships.
//
// Storage locks are logical node locks backed by InnoDB MTR page latches.
// Multiple nodes may reside on the same data page, so two logical storage
// locks may correspond to the same physical page latch.
//
// In particular, an MTR permits repeated X-latching of the same page, but
// does not permit repeated S-latching of the same page. Callers must
// therefore account for page identity when acquiring multiple storage
// locks, even when the corresponding nodes are distinct.
//
// Currently, the link operations do not require multiple shared storage
// latches: an operation holds at most one S|X node storage latch at a
// time.

// Bidirectional links
//
// A node's outgoing link is a directed connection from the current node to
// another node. The target node must exist, but it need not have a link back
// to the current node.
//
// A node's incoming link represents the fact that another node may have a
// connection to the current node. The source node must have existed when the
// incoming link was created, but may subsequently be deleted and exist as a
// free node. The target node must belong to the storage level segment for
// the current level.
//
// A bidirectional connection between N1 and N2 can therefore be established
// without simultaneously latching both nodes:
//
//   1. N1:  Create an incoming link for N2.
//   2. N2:  Create a directed link to N1.
//   3. N1:  Replace the incoming link for N2 with the outgoing link to N2.
//
// Each step is an independent atomic operation and leaves the graph in a
// valid state. In practice, steps 2 and 3 are performed while holding the
// Level Operation Lock.
//
// An incoming link must never be removed without holding the Level Operation
// Lock and the storage latches required to modify both the source and target
// records. The Level Operation Lock prevents a concurrent graph operation
// from establishing or retaining the corresponding outgoing link while the
// incoming link is being removed.
