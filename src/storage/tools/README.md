# SVECTOR Page Dump Tool

A standalone diagnostic tool for inspecting SVECTOR column storage pages in InnoDB tablespace files.

## Overview

This tool reads and displays the internal structure of SVECTOR storage pages directly from `.ibd` (InnoDB Data File) files. It's useful for:

- **Debugging**: Verify page format and data integrity
- **Development**: Understand the storage layout during development
- **Analysis**: Examine page utilization and fragmentation
- **Troubleshooting**: Diagnose storage-related issues

## Building

The tool can be built standalone with access to the VillageSQL SDK headers:

```bash
cd villagesql/examples/vsql-svector/src/storage/tools
make
```

By default `SOURCE_ROOT` is set to `../../../../../..` (the VillageSQL source root). Override it if your layout differs:

```bash
make SOURCE_ROOT=/path/to/villagesql-source
```

This will produce the `svector_page_dump` executable.

## Usage

```bash
svector_page_dump <ibd_file> <root_page_num> [options]
```

### Arguments

- `<ibd_file>`: Path to the InnoDB tablespace file (e.g., `table.ibd`)
- `<root_page_num>`: Page number of the SVECTOR root page within the tablespace

### Options

- `-v, --verbose`: Show detailed information including free slot arrays
- `-r, --records`: Display record data (shows first 10 records per page)
- `-d, --data-page N`: Display a specific data page by page number
- `-a, --all-pages`: Traverse and display all data pages linked from root
- `-i, --index`: Treat the root page as an HNSW index root page -- decode its
  metadata as index metadata (level, entry level/points) and decode data
  page records as HNSW NeighbourEntry/OverflowEntry instead of a plain
  SVECTOR vector
- `-g, --graph`: Render the HNSW graph reachable from the root page's entry
  point as ASCII tree art, walking every level via NID links. Requires `-i`
  and a level-0 primary store root page (see "Show the HNSW Graph" below)
- `--max-nodes N`: Cap on distinct nodes rendered by `-g`/`--graph` across
  all levels combined (default: 50)
- `--graph-style tree|list`: How `-g`/`--graph` renders each level -- `tree`
  (default) draws nested tree art; `list` prints one flat adjacency line per
  node instead (see "Show the HNSW Graph" below)
- `-h, --help`: Show help message

## Examples

### 1. Show Root Page Only

```bash
./svector_page_dump table.ibd 4
```

Output shows:
- Version and creator information
- Column size (vector dimensions)
- Total/free data page counts
- Free slot array summary

### 2. Verbose Root Page Display

```bash
./svector_page_dump table.ibd 4 -v
```

Additional output:
- Complete free slot array listing
- Details of each slot's page reference

### 3. Show Specific Data Page

```bash
./svector_page_dump table.ibd 4 -d 5
```

Shows data page #5:
- Page metadata
- Free list links
- Record capacity and utilization
- Record bitmap

### 4. Show Data Page with Records

```bash
./svector_page_dump table.ibd 4 -d 5 -r
```

Additional output:
- First 10 allocated records
- Transaction references
- Vector data values

### 5. Traverse All Pages

```bash
./svector_page_dump table.ibd 4 -a -v
```

Traverses all data pages linked from the root and displays:
- Each page's metadata and statistics
- Overall storage structure

### 6. Show an HNSW Index Root Page

```bash
./svector_page_dump table.ibd 4 -i -d 5 -r
```

Each HNSW level's primary and overflow store has its own root page (see
`src/index/hnsw/storage.h`), so `<root_page_num>` names one such store.
With `-i`, root page output shows:
- The store's name, level, and (for the level-0 primary store) the graph's
  entry level and entry point
- The record layout (NeighbourEntry or OverflowEntry, with max neighbours or
  overflow capacity) implied by column size, instead of a float vector
  dimension count

and data page records decode as NeighbourEntry (owner, lower-level link,
neighbours, overflow chain) or OverflowEntry (incoming links, overflow
chain) fields instead of vector floats.

### 7. Show the HNSW Graph

```bash
./svector_page_dump table.ibd 4 -i -g
```

Renders the graph reachable from `<root_page_num>`'s entry point as ASCII
tree art, one level at a time:

```
HNSW Graph (M=16, entry level 1, showing up to 50 nodes)

Level 1 (entry)
•4:0
├─ •7:2
└─ •12:5
   └─ •4:0  ...

Level 0
•4:0
├─ •2:9
│  ├─ •9:2
│  └─ •15:4
├─ •7:3
└─ •22:0
```

Only `<root_page_num>` (the level-0 primary store) is needed -- every other
level and page is found by following NID links embedded in each node's own
record, the same way a real search descends the graph. A neighbour already
drawn elsewhere in the same level is shown as a `...` leaf rather
than re-expanded, since HNSW levels are graphs, not trees. `--max-nodes`
(default 50) bounds how many distinct nodes are fetched across the whole
walk; nodes beyond that show as `(truncated)` leaves. Add `-v` to also show
each node's owner VID as `<node>(<vid>)`.

For levels with many edges per node, `--graph-style list` prints a flat
adjacency line per node instead of nested tree art:

```bash
./svector_page_dump table.ibd 4 -i -g --graph-style list
```

```
HNSW Graph (M=16, entry level 1, showing up to 50 nodes)

Level 1 (entry)
•4:0(10:0) -> [7:2(10:3)] degree=1

Level 0
•4:0(10:0) -> [2:9(10:5), 7:3(10:3)] degree=2
•2:9(10:5) -> [4:0(10:0), 9:2(10:7), 15:4(10:8)] degree=3
•7:3(10:3) -> [4:0(10:0)] degree=1
```

Every node reachable from the level's entry point is listed exactly once
(BFS order), each showing its own outgoing neighbours and degree; there is
no `...`/`(seen above)` marker since a node is never re-expanded once
listed.

## Example: inspecting a data page with delete-marked records

The following shows output after inserting 5 rows into a `SVECTOR(4)` column and
then deleting two of them (ids 2 and 4) before the InnoDB purge thread has run.
The delete-marked slots remain physically present in the page until purge. The
SVECTOR column store holds the vector and its MVCC transaction id only; row
identity lives in the HNSW index, not here.

```bash
$ svector_page_dump embeddings.ibd 4 -d 6 -r
```

```

Records (showing from slot 0, up to 10 records):
  [  0] Trx ID:        1001 Data:[0.10, 0.20, 0.30, 0.40]
  [  1] Trx ID:        1002 Data:[0.90, 0.80, 0.70, 0.60] (DELETED)

  [  3] Trx ID:        1004 Data:[3.14, 2.72, 1.41, 1.73] (DELETED)
  [  4] Trx ID:        1005 Data:[0.11, 0.22, 0.33, 0.44]
```

Key observations:
- **`DELETED` records** (slots 1 and 3) are still physically present and visible
  to concurrent transactions that started before the DELETE committed (MVCC).
  They are reclaimed by the purge thread once no active transaction can see them.
- **Record Bitmap** encodes each slot's state in 2 bits: `A` = active (occupied,
  not deleted), `D` = delete-marked (occupied, pending purge), `.` = free
  (available for insert).
- **Free Slot Number `0`** means this data page is tracked at index 0 in the root
  page's free slot array, making it eligible for the next insert without a root
  page scan.
- The owning row's primary key is stored by the HNSW index (inline on a graph
  node or in the index's primary-key store), not in this column store, so an
  index hit resolves back to its row via the index.

## Finding Root Page Number

The root page number is stored in the table's metadata. You can find it by:

**From Information Schema** (if available):
- TBD TODO(villagesql-indexing):

## Implementation Notes

- The tool reads pages directly from the `.ibd` file using standard file I/O
- It uses the same page format constants as defined in `../root_page.h` and `../data_page.h`
- Requires the VillageSQL SDK headers (`villagesql/experimental/storage_api.h`) for page offset constants
- Assumes default InnoDB page size of 16KB
- Safety limit of 100 pages when using `--all-pages` to prevent infinite loops

## Limitations

- Currently only supports 16KB page size (standard InnoDB default)
- Vector data displayed as float32 (actual storage may use different precision)
- Does not validate checksums or page consistency
- Cannot handle compressed tablespaces
- Read-only tool - does not modify tablespace files

## Development

The tool consists of:

- `page_reader.{h,cc}`: Low-level page reading from `.ibd` files
- `root_page_parser.{h,cc}`: Parse and display SVECTOR root pages
- `data_page_parser.{h,cc}`: Parse and display SVECTOR data pages
- `hnsw_layout.{h,cc}`: Reimplements the HNSW index's on-disk metadata and
  record layouts (see `../../index/hnsw/storage.h` and `hnsw.h`) for `-i`
  mode, independent of the HNSW index sources
- `hnsw_graph.{h,cc}`: Walks and renders the HNSW graph as ASCII tree art for
  `-g`/`--graph`, following NID links level by level via `hnsw_layout.h`
- `svector_page_dump.cc`: Main driver program

All components use the format definitions from `../root_page.h` and `../data_page.h` to stay in sync with the server implementation. `hnsw_layout.{h,cc}` must be kept in sync by hand with `../../index/hnsw/storage.h`/`hnsw.h` the same way, since it does not link against them.
